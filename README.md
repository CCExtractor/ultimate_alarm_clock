## What's New?

During the GSOC'24 period, the following features were implemented by Contributor Aryan Saraf:

### 1) Migrating Alarm Scheduling logic and Smart Controls logic to Kotlin

The previous alarm scheduling logic and smart controls would launch the app when working in the background due to reliance on Flutter method channels for database access and functions. To resolve this, we have migrated the Alarm Scheduling and Smart Controls logic from Flutter to Kotlin.
Pull-Requests: [#563](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/563) [#574](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/574) [#580](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/580)

### 2) Cross-communication between Flutter and Kotin

Switching to SQLite databases will enhance cross-language data accessibility and streamline native feature integration. Earlier, we used Method Channels to extract data from the ISAR database for scheduling alarms upon booting, which triggers MainActivity and launches the app from the background. Transitioning to SQLite will improve flexibility and adaptability for future developments as it can be directly used by Kotlin.
Issue: [#562](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/562), Pull-Request: [#563](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/563)

### 3) Profile Switcher and Alarm/Profile Sharing

Effortlessly manage and share custom alarm profiles for different days and occasions, ensuring only the active profile’s alarms are prioritized. Alarms and profiles can now be shared with other users using their emails. In-app notifications for received alarms and profiles with the option to either accept or reject them.
Issue: [#591](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/591), Pull-Request: [#584](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/584)

### 4) Google Calendar Integration and Date-based Scheduling

Integrate Google Calendar to import reminders, events and aggregate alarms. Users can now create alarms that can be triggered on a specific date
Issue: [#590](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/590), Pull-Request: [#584](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/584)

### 5) Guardian Angel

Set a Guardian Angel to send a call or SMS to if you fail to wake up for important events, ensuring you never miss crucial moments.
Issue: [#592](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/592), Pull-Request: [#584](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/584)

### 6) Anti-disturbance

Automatically dismiss alarms if the user’s screen is on for more than X minutes, indicating they are busy and don’t need the alarm.”
Issue: [#572](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/572), Pull-Request: [#574](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/574)

### 7) Open-meteo integration and weather fetch logic shift to Kotlin, Location access notification

Switch to Open-Meteo for weather API for seamless weather integration without the need for an API key, reducing setup friction and streamlining the user experience. Add Notification for user location being accessed in the background. Weather and Location-based smart controls logic shifted to Kotlin.
Issue: [#579](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/579), Pull-Request: [#580](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/580)

### 8) Timer

Revamped the timer with multiple timer support, an easy-to-use UI, notification display when minimized, and direct Kotlin database access for faster performance without relying on Flutter for data.
Issue: [#564](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/564), Pull-Request: [#565](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/565)

### 9) Ringtones

“Added 5 new royalty-free ringtones and fixed related bugs, including erratic ringtone preview behaviour.”
Issue: [#595](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/issues/595), Pull-Request: [#596](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ultimate_alarm_clock/pull/596)

### 10) UI and bug fixes

- Fixed Several Controller errors throughout different PRs.
- New UI for alarm and profile setting screen.
- Fixed existing Firebase Auth implementation.

## GetX Pattern

The "Ultimate Alarm Clock" project employs the GetX pattern for state management. The GetX pattern is a popular state management solution in the Flutter ecosystem, known for its simplicity, efficiency, and developer-friendly approach. It simplifies the process of managing the state of a Flutter application and helps in building reactive and performant user interfaces.

### Using `get_cli` for Project Development

The "Ultimate Alarm Clock" project uses `get_cli`, a powerful Flutter package that simplifies various aspects of project development, such as generating new pages, routes, and more. Below, we'll briefly explain how to use `get_cli` for creating new pages and touch upon the purpose of different files in a GetX-based Flutter project.

#### Installing `get_cli`

To get started with `get_cli`, you need to install it. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
flutter pub global activate get_cli
```

#### Creating a New Page

With `get_cli`, you can quickly generate the necessary files for a new page. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
get create page:/your_page_name
```

Replace `/your_page_name` with the desired name for your new page. This command will create several files and folders for your page, including a controller, view, and binding.

### Purpose of Different Files

- **Controller**: The controller is responsible for handling the business logic and state management of a page. It connects the UI (View) with the underlying data and functions.
- **View**: The view represents the UI of the page. It defines how the page should look and interact with users. It focuses on the presentation of data.
- **Binding**: The binding connects the controller and view, ensuring that they work together seamlessly. It sets up dependencies, routes, and other configurations required for the page.

To learn more about the GetX, you can read the documentation [_here_](https://chornthorn.github.io/getx-docs/).

## Database Schema

The "Ultimate Alarm Clock" project utilizes multiple databases for different purposes. These databases include Firebase Firestore, ISAR, and Flutter Secure Storage. Each database serves a distinct role in managing various aspects of the application. Below we provide an overview of the schema for each of these databases.

### Firebase Firestore

Firebase Firestore is used for real-time data synchronization and storage of user-related data. It plays a pivotal role in enabling features like shared alarms and seamless collaboration among users. Here's why Firestore is a necessary component:

- **Shared Alarms**: Firestore allows users to share alarms with one another in real-time. Users can collaborate on alarm settings, making it convenient for multiple individuals to set alarms for a common purpose.

- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore enables instant updates and synchronization of alarm data across devices and users. This means that any changes made to shared alarms are immediately reflected on all connected devices.

### ISAR

ISAR is the go-to solution for local storage of alarm-related data. It facilitates the efficient and structured management of alarm settings and preferences, ensuring that alarms function smoothly even in offline scenarios. ISAR optimizes data retrieval, enabling quick access to triggered alarms and user-specific configurations. Its performance efficiency and data integrity make it an essential component, ensuring that alarms trigger accurately and promptly. ISAR complements Firestore's real-time data synchronization, offering a responsive local data store to enhance the overall user experience.

The key reasons for utilizing IsarDb are as follows:

- **Offline Functionality**: IsarDb ensures that alarms function seamlessly even in offline scenarios. Users can trust that their alarms will trigger as expected, regardless of their internet connection status.

- **Performance Optimization**: IsarDb optimizes data retrieval, allowing for quick access to triggered alarms and user-specific configurations. It enhances the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.

The schema for this data is already described above.

### SQFLITE

SQFLite is a Flutter plugin that allows you to use SQLite databases in your Flutter applications. Using SQLite database we can share alarm data between dart and kotlin or other native languages without the need for calling method channels.

- **Cross Communication Between Dart and Native**: SqLite database can be accessed by any native language with ease, allowing for seamless flow of data between the two.

- **Performance Optimization**: Performance and data retrieval times are improved as need for method channels for fetching data is eliminated.

The schema is same as described above.

### Flutter Secure Storage

The Flutter Secure Storage library is utilized in the "Ultimate Alarm Clock" project for securely storing various settings and preferences. This storage solution employs key-value pairs to manage and access data. Below are the keys and their associated purposes:

- `userModel`: Stores user-related data in a JSON-encoded format, including user settings and preferences.

- `weather_state`: Stores the current weather state information.

- `API keys`: Several keys are used for storing API keys securely, allowing the application to access external services.

- `Haptic Feedback`: Key-value pairs are used to store and manage user preferences related to haptic feedback settings.

- `Sorted Alarm List`: Key-value pairs are used to store and manage user preferences for sorting the alarm list.

- `theme_value`: Stores the selected theme (e.g., dark or light) for the application.

Flutter Secure Storage is instrumental in ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive user data and preferences, contributing to a seamless and secure user experience in the "Ultimate Alarm Clock" project.

### Shared Alarms

The "Ultimate Alarm Clock" project introduces the feature of shared alarms, allowing users to collaborate with friends, family members, or colleagues to ensure they wake up on time.

#### Creating and Joining Shared Alarms

1. **Google Sign-In**: To create or join a shared alarm, users must first sign in with their Google account. This authentication step ensures that only registered users can access this feature and maintains the security of shared alarms.

2. **Creating a Shared Alarm**:

   - From the Home View, users can create a new alarm by tapping the "Create Alarm" button.
   - During the alarm creation process, users have the option to make it a "shared alarm."

3. **Joining an Existing Shared Alarm**:

   - Users can join an existing shared alarm by entering a unique shared alarm ID or accepting an invitation from the owner.
   - The shared alarm ID is a unique code that the owner shares with potential collaborators.

#### Implementation of Shared Alarms

##### `addUserToAlarmSharedUsers`

The `addUserToAlarmSharedUsers` function enables users to add new collaborators to a shared alarm. Here's how it works:

- When a user initiates the process to join a shared alarm, this function is called.
- It begins by checking whether the provided alarm ID exists in the database.
- If the alarm ID is not found, the function returns `false`, indicating that the addition process failed.
- If the alarm ID is found, the function proceeds to add the user as a collaborator.
- If the user is the owner of the alarm, the function returns `null`, preventing the owner from being added as a collaborator.
- The function then updates the list of shared user IDs and offset details for the alarm. It sets `isOffsetBefore` to `true`, `offsetDuration` to `0`, and `offsettedTime` to the alarm's original time.
- The user is added to the list of shared user IDs, and the changes are instantly synchronized with all collaborators.

##### `removeUserFromAlarmSharedUsers`

The `removeUserFromAlarmSharedUsers` function allows the owner of a shared alarm, to remove a collaborator from the shared alarm. Here's how it works:

- When the owner initiates the removal process, this function is called.
- Similar to the previous function, it begins by checking whether the provided alarm ID exists in the database.
- If the alarm ID is not found, the function returns an empty list, indicating that the removal process failed due to the alarm's non-existence.
- If the alarm ID is found, the function proceeds to remove the specified user from the list of shared user IDs.
- After the removal, the function updates the shared user IDs for the alarm, and the changes are immediately synchronized with all collaborators.

##### `streamAlarms`

1. **Data Sources**: It combines data from three primary data sources:

   - **Firestore**: Alarms stored in the Firestore database.
   - **Shared Alarms**: Alarms shared with the user through collaboration.
   - **IsarDB**: Alarms stored locally for offline use.

2. **Data Transformation**: The function processes the data retrieved from these sources. This transformation includes converting the raw document snapshots into `AlarmModel` objects, a data structure that represents alarm records.

3. **Sorting**: Depending on user preferences, the alarms are sorted. Users have the option to enable or disable sorting, and two different sorting methods are applied based on this preference:

   - **Time-Based Sorting**: If the sorting preference is enabled, the alarms are sorted in ascending order based on their scheduled time.
   - **Priority Sorting**: If the sorting preference is disabled, the alarms are organized based on priority:
     - First, the enabled alarms are listed ahead of disabled ones.
     - Then, alarms are sorted by their upcoming time, factoring in repetition patterns and immediate execution for one-time alarms.

4. **Returned Stream**: After these processes, the function returns a stream (`streamAlarms`) that represents the list of alarms. This stream reflects the real-time status of alarms and is used to update the user interface whenever alarms are added, modified, or removed.

The "Ultimate Alarm Clock" offers an intuitive and feature-rich user interface, making it easy to set, manage, and customize your alarms while providing a seamless experience.
